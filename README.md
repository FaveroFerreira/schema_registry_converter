# schema_registry_converter

This library is provides a way of using the Confluent Schema Registry in a way that is compliant with the usual jvm useage.
For now only the consuming and thus decoding is supported, encoding will be added soon, but supposes the schema's needed are already available in the schema registry.
Feel free to open een issue/pr to add functionality to add the schema from this crate.
